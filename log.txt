 Example command: 
For third-gen sequencing: DBG2OLC LD1 0 Contigs contig.fa k 17 KmerCovTh 2 MinOverlap 20 AdaptiveTh 0.005 f reads_file1.fq/fa f reads_file2.fq/fa
For sec-gen sequencing: DBG2OLC LD1 0 Contigs contig.fa k 31 KmerCovTh 0 MinOverlap 50 PathCovTh 1 f reads_file1.fq/fa f reads_file2.fq/fa
Parameters:
MinLen: min read length for a read to be used.
Contigs:  contig file to be used.
k: k-mer size.
LD: load compressed reads information. You can set to 1 if you have run the algorithm for one round and just want to fine tune the following parameters.
PARAMETERS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR THE PERFORMANCE:
If you have high coverage, set large values to these parameters.
KmerCovTh: k-mer matching threshold for each solid contig. (suggest 2-10)
MinOverlap: min matching k-mers for each two reads. (suggest 10-150)
AdaptiveTh: [Specific for third-gen sequencing] adaptive k-mer threshold for each solid contig. (suggest 0.001-0.02)
PathCovTh: [Specific for Illumina sequencing] occurence threshold for a compressed read. (suggest 1-3)
